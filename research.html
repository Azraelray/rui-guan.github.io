                  <strong>Improving Individual Consistency Under Cognitive Limitations: The Effect of Sequential Elimination </strong> (Job Market Paper) 
                </p> 
                <p> <i>Abstract:</i> I study individual consistency with preference maximization by examining two choice procedures: namely, the direct procedure, where people choose directly from the menu, and the sequential elimination procedure, where they sequentially eliminate alternatives until only one survives. In a limited attention framework, I show that, in sequential elimination, the choices made by a decision maker faced with at least two available alternatives are consistent with preference maximization, whereas this is not necessarily the case in the direct procedure. To test empirically whether sequential elimination facilitates consistency, I implement an experiment in which subjects are randomly assigned to a risky decision-making task involving one of the two procedures. I find evidence that sequential elimination leads to an economically meaningful improvement in the consistency of subjects with low cognitive ability. Next, I explore the factors that influence individual preference for sequential elimination. Finally, I investigate the impacts of sequential elimination on risk preferences and individual satisfaction.

                  <strong>Making Decisions By Seeing or Hearing? The Role of Senses on Economic Rationality </strong> (with Fadong Chen)
                </p> 
                <p> <i>Abstract:</i> Human choice behavior primarily depends on two basic senses: seeing and hearing. However, there is little research on whether the economic consequences of making decisions with these two senses differ. This paper examines this question with respect to economic rationality. We design and implement a randomized controlled experiment where subjects are randomly assigned to make decisions by hearing or by seeing. We find that making decisions by hearing, compared to seeing, leads to severe impairment in economic rationality. We also find that subjects spend more time making decisions when hearing the options than when seeing the options. Furthermore, subjects, especially females, reveal lower risk aversion when making decisions by hearing than by seeing. Our results highlight the importance of basic senses in economic decision-making.
