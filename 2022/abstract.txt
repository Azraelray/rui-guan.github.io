Evidence suggests that individual behavior may deviate from preference maximization due to limited attention to alternatives. I study this issue by developing a framework that incorporates choice procedures where individuals consider at least two available alternatives. I show that choices made under sequential elimination (where individuals sequentially eliminate alternatives until only one survives) always maximize preferences, whereas choices made directly from menus do not. Using a controlled experiment, I find that sequential elimination substantially improves individual consistency with preference maximization, especially for subjects with low cognitive ability. Moreover, I explore individual preferences for sequential elimination and their implications.
